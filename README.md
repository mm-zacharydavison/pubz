# `pubb`

```bash
bunx pubb
```

`pubb` publishes multiple packages in one command, with some useful steps:

1. Prompts you to bump version number of packages.
2. Prompts you for where you want to publish (e.g. `npm` or private registry).
3. Prompts you to create a `git tag` and push it.

# Example

```bash
bunx pubb
```
